🚀 CodeSoft Internship | Level 1 – Task 2

As part of my CodeSoft Internship, I successfully completed Task 2 – Landing Page using HTML and CSS.
This project helped me understand layout structuring, flexbox alignment, styling, and basic animations.
Grateful for the learning opportunity and excited to build more projects ahead ✨
